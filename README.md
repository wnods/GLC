# GLC - Generator Level Curves

## Overview

GLC is a Python project aimed at constructing contour maps or level curves of a function with two or more variables. The project was inspired by exercises from a Calculus III course on partial derivatives. It is implemented in a straightforward manner to facilitate visualization.

## Features

- Generate level curves for multivariable functions
- Simple and intuitive code structure

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wnods/GLC.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd GLC
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to generate and visualize the level curves:
```bash
python main.py
